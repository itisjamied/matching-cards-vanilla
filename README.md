# Memory Matching Game (Vanilla)

## Description

This Memory Matching Game is a fun and interactive way to test your memory! The game consists of a 5x5 grid of cards, each with a hidden color on one side. Players flip over two cards at a time, with the goal of finding pairs of cards with matching colors. When a match is found, the cards remain flipped over. The game continues until all pairs are found. Designed with simplicity in mind, it provides a challenge for both kids and adults.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. This will provide you with npm, the default package manager for Node.js. You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If these commands return versions, you're ready to go. If not, please install Node.js and npm from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/) first.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://yourrepositoryurl.com
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd  matching-cards-vanilla
```

If your project uses any npm packages, install them:

```bash
npm install
```

Note: For this basic game, you might not need to run `npm install` unless you're using packages for development tools like a local server.

### Running the Game

To run the game, if you have set up a script in your `package.json` that starts a local development server, you can use:

```bash
npm start
```

If you haven't set up a package that requires running a server, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to play the game.
